"Under A Dome"

Under a dome
While we wait for it
We feel all of it
Wait
Looking back on it

Under a dome
Where I met you first
Fuck the way we were
Wait
Watch the colour burst

Under a dome
In a foreign place
Heard you call my name
Stay
Watch the tide roll in

Under a dome
Where I met you first
Fuck the way we were
Wait
Watch the colour burst

I'm taking over my own throne
I'm holding my heart and it's overgrown
I'm kicking out, I'm full of life
So why should I cry over northern lights
And it's over now and I'm falling (and I'm falling)
And I'm falling (and I'm falling)
(And I'm falling)
So fuck all the times that I've fallen
(And I'm falling)
Creature, you're part of this loving game
But it's over now and I'm falling
(And I'm falling)
(And I'm falling)
