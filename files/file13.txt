"Destroyer"

I want to be the king of my body and mind
Gravity let me go
Before it bruises and blackens me and you
Bury me in the glow

And I find sorrow in idle mind
And solace in being heard

You better run boy run but be afraid
Cry boy cry don't play the game
Gravity holds me down

And it's taking over
I call everywhere, oh
I cry out

You are my destroyer
I call everywhere, oh
I cry out

A light shines through a cloud of colour fumes
Gravity let me go
So I can feel the warmth of the sun
Bury me in the glow

You better run boy run but be afraid
Cry boy cry don't play the game
Gravity holds me down

And it's taking over
I call everywhere, oh
I cry out

You are my destroyer
I call everywhere, oh
I cry out

And it's taking over
I call everywhere, oh
I cry out

You are my destroyer
I call everywhere, oh
I cry out
