"Róróró"

I am up with the sunrise
I'm tired and I think I want to go home
So let's go and get started
Do you hear me calling, crying out
I run up to the house
Catch me if you think you can

Oh what a shame cause I know
With open arms then I could hold it all
Oh what a shame that I row
To the edges so that I can fall off
No one's to blame but I know
With open arms then I could keep you close
Oh what a shame that I row
To the edges so that I can fall off

I could be centered and in place
In a field full of poppies I could dream you all away
But I know that I've got to get running
Do you hear that roaring, pulsing sound
I run up to the house
You can follow if you dare

Oh what a shame cause I know
With open arms then I could hold it all
Oh what a shame that I row
To the edges so that I can fall off
No one's to blame and I know it
With open arms then I could keep you close
Oh what a shame that I row
To the edges so that I can fall off

But I'm not
No I'm not ready for this
But I'm not
No I'm not ready for this

Do you want it?
Do you want it to be true?
But I'm not
No I'm not ready for this (Oh what a shame)
Do you need it?
Do you need it to be true?
But I'm not
No I'm not ready for this (Oh what a shame)

Do you want it?
Do you want it to be true?
But I'm not
No I'm not ready for this (Oh what a shame)
Do you need it?
Do you need me to tell the truth?
But I'm not
No I'm not ready for this
